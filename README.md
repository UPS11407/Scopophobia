# Scopophobia
 Short horror game I made for my partner

 This repository is a collection of all that I personally created within the project. Many models, textures, sfx, and vfx were imported from 3rd party websites and as such I cannot include them here. I have included a file [here](https://github.com/UPS11407/scopophobia/blob/main/Assets/ImportedAssets.txt) that has a list of all the assets that were imported and where I located them.  

**The Project Will Not Be Functional Without All Of The Assets Listed**
